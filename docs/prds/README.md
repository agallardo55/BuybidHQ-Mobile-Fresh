# Product Requirements Documents

This directory contains product requirements documents (PRDs).

## Purpose

PRDs define product features, user requirements, and business logic. These documents guide feature development and should be referenced when building new functionality.

## Files

Currently empty - PRDs will be added here as needed.

## Workflow

- Check existing PRDs before building features
- Create PRDs for significant new features
- Update PRDs when requirements change
