## Best Practices

### Building Your Buyer Network

✅ **Start with quality over quantity**
- Focus on responsive, reliable buyers first
- Add 5-10 core buyers initially
- Expand as you learn who responds

✅ **Keep information current**
- Verify mobile numbers quarterly
- Update company names if they change
- Remove buyers who never respond

✅ **Use descriptive group names**
- Be specific (e.g., "Manheim Auction Buyers" not "Group 1")
- Use consistent naming convention
- Create both broad and specific groups

✅ **Add internal notes**
- Track buyer preferences (e.g., "Prefers luxury vehicles")
- Note special relationships
- Document communication preferences

---

### Organizing for Efficiency

**Create these standard groups:**
1. **All Buyers** - Everyone in your network
2. **Primary Buyers** - Your go-to buyers (5-10 people)
3. **Secondary Buyers** - Backup buyers
4. **Vehicle Type Groups** - By specialization
5. **Regional Groups** - By location

**Workflow Example:**
- Quick sale needed → Send to Primary Buyers
- Testing market → Send to All Buyers
- Specialty vehicle → Send to specific Vehicle Type Group

---

### Maintaining Buyer Relationships

✅ **Communicate outside the platform**
- Call buyers occasionally
- Follow up on offers
- Thank top responders

✅ **Be selective with bid requests**
- Don't spam buyers with every vehicle
- Send relevant vehicles based on buyer preferences
- Quality over quantity

✅ **Respond promptly to buyer questions**
- Answer within 1 hour if possible
- Be honest about vehicle condition
- Provide additional photos if requested
