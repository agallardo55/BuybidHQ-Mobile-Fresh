## Understanding Bid Request Status

### Delivery Status

Each buyer shows one of these statuses:

**Sent** 📤
- SMS has been sent from our system
- Awaiting carrier delivery confirmation

**Delivered** ✅
- SMS successfully delivered to buyer's phone
- Buyer can now view the request

**Failed** ❌
- SMS delivery failed
- Possible reasons: Invalid number, carrier issue, blocked number

**Viewed** 👁️
- Buyer opened the link
- Viewing vehicle details

**Responded** 💬
- Buyer submitted an offer
- Offer visible in responses section

{% hint style="info" %}
**Pro Tip:** If status shows "Sent" for more than 5 minutes, the buyer may have phone issues. Try calling them directly.
{% endhint %}

## Taking Action on Offers

3. Buyer is marked as "Accepted" (visible only to you)
4. Contact buyer directly to finalize sale

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important:** BuybidHQ doesn't handle payment processing. You'll need to coordinate payment and pickup with the buyer directly.
{% endhint %}

---

### Rejecting an Offer

1. Find the offer to reject
2. Click **Reject** or **Decline**
3. Offer is marked as "Rejected" (visible only to you)
4. Optionally add a reason for your records

**When to Reject:**

- Already accepted another offer
- Buyer not responsive
- Vehicle sold elsewhere

---

### Following Up with Buyers

**Best Practices:**

✅ **Respond within 1 hour** - Show buyers you're professional and responsive

✅ **Answer questions honestly** - Build trust for future deals

✅ **Provide additional photos** - If buyer requests specific angles

## Response Notifications

### How You're Notified

## No Responses Yet?

### What to Do

**If no responses within 1 hour:**

1. **Check delivery status** - Did SMS actually deliver?
2. **Follow up with buyers** - Call your top 2-3 buyers directly
3. **Review your pricing** - Is the vehicle condition/price competitive?
4. **Send to more buyers** - Add to your buyer network or send to additional groups

**Common Reasons for Low Response:**

❌ **Poor photo quality** - Buyers can't assess condition
❌ **Unrealistic pricing** - Price doesn't match condition/market
❌ **Wrong buyer selection** - Sent to buyers who don't specialize in that vehicle type
❌ **Timing issues** - Sent after hours or on weekends
❌ **Vehicle condition concerns** - Visible damage without explanation
